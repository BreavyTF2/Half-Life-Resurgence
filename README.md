# Half-Life-Resurgence
An addon for Garry's Mod that aims to recreate NPCs, entities and weapons from the Half-Life series.

**ROADMAP:** https://github.com/orgs/VJ-HLR-Developers/projects/1

### What the goals for Half-Life Resurgence? Here is a quick list:
- Recreate every possible NPC, entity, and some weapons from the Half-Life series in Garry's Mod using Lua.
- Use the original effects, particles, decals and textures. This is something that was never done in Garry's Mod before.
- Add cut content that were never included in the retail version and reimagine them if no information was given by Valve.
- Add more features and extra characters that we or the community has imagined! Examples: HECU engineer that can construct turrets, Black Ops Robo Grunts, content from Sven Coop, and many more!
- Another goal is to make every single NPC fully controllable, allowing the player to play as any character they want!

### List of branches:
>* **master**  --->  The base pack.
>* **hlr_hd**  --->  HD version of the base pack (Mostly for *Half-Life 1* NPCs).
