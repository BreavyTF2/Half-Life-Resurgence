# Half-Life-Resurgence
An addon for Garry's Mod that aims to recreate NPCs, entities and weapons from the Half-Life series.

**ROADMAP:** https://github.com/orgs/VJ-HLR-Developers/projects/1

### Quick overview of the features and goals of Half-Life Resurgence:
- Recreate every possible NPC, entity, and some weapons from the Half-Life series with respect to the original games.
- Use only the original effects, particles, decals and textures wherever possible.
- Recreate cut, alpha, and beta content, if no information is given by Valve, then reimagine them to the best of our ability.
- Add new features, including new abilities, AI behaviors, weapons, etc. Examples: HECU engineers can construct turrets, new weapons for Rebels, and many more!
- Add custom content that we or the community have envisioned. Examples: Black Ops Robo Grunts, Combine & Rebel engineers, content from Sven Coop, and much more!
- Add NPC Controller support to all the NPCs, allowing the user to play as any character.
- Introduce an optional feature that automatically replaces Half-Life 1 & 2 NPCs with their Half-Life-Resurgence counterpart.
- Add support for Half-Life 1 & 2 campaigns to the necessary NPCs, allowing the user to play any of the campaign using the Auto Replace feature.

### List of branches:
>* **master**  --->  The base pack.
